# Ainaa - Goal Tracking Web Application

Ainaa is a goal-tracking web application inspired by apps like Strides, Duolingo, Habitica, and Reflectly. It provides a user-friendly interface to help users manage their daily activities, track long-term goals, and reflect on their progress through journaling. The app aims to assist users in identifying latent traits that might hinder their work ethic development through gradual progress and continual habit tracking.

This project was developed as part of the **COMP-206** course at Kathmandu University for the partial fulfillment of the 2nd Year/1st Semester in Computer Engineering.
